# Sentinel Governance (Draft)

This document defines governance expectations for high-impact moderation changes.

## Scope

Applies to changes affecting:

- policy outcomes
- reason-code mappings
- lexicon/language-pack releases
- election-phase controls

## Decision Rules

- Any moderation-outcome change requires at least two maintainer approvals.
- Legal/privacy impacting changes require explicit checklist sign-off.
- Emergency changes must include post-incident retrospective updates.

## Review Artifacts

Every behavior-changing PR must include:

- task ID from `docs/specs/tasks.md`
- RFC/ADR references
- test evidence and rollback notes

## Community Safeguards

- Contributions must follow code of conduct.
- Language pack and lexicon proposals require documented evidence samples.
- Appeals and transparency commitments must remain auditable.
