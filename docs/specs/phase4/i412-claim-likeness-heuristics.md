# I-412 Claim-Likeness Heuristics (Baseline)

## Purpose

Records deterministic features and scoring logic used by the `I-412` disinformation claim-likeness baseline.

## Required Contents (to be completed during implementation)

1. Feature list with exact extraction rules.
2. Feature weights and score normalization method.
3. Threshold mapping from score to categorical bands (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
4. Known failure modes and conservative fallback behavior.
5. Versioning and change-control procedure.
